# 🏋️‍♂️ Cardio Good Fitness Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project explores and analyzes the `CardioGoodFitness.csv` dataset, which contains information about customers of a fitness product company. The goal is to derive meaningful insights through data analysis and visualization, and potentially apply machine learning techniques to predict customer behavior or trends.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset includes customer-related attributes such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Income
- Product Purchased (TM195, TM498, TM798)
- Fitness Level
- Usage (times per week)
- Miles Run
- Education
- Marital Status

These features help in understanding customer segmentation, product preferences, and usage trends.
